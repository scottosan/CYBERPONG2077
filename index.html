Don't ask me how i got my hands on this. Lets just say that i had to deal with a couple of questionable VR junkies. Back to the point. We've got a new job. Arasaka is paying us good money to breakdown Maelstrom's power supply fraud scheme. Tell me when you're ready."</div>

        <p>"The Maelstrom Corp has been working on a global power grid for the past couple of years. However, in typical Capitalist fashion, they've got a hidden agenda on their hands. The design pulls electricity from all of Night City's public power supply and they plan to redistribute that energy as "clean energy". I've managed to gain remote access from a mili-tech network to hack into their mainframe."
